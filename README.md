Created a ‘City Info’ Web API by completed Kevin Dockx ASP.NET Core 6 Web API Fundamentals course on Pluralsight. 
The Web API returns information about cities and points of interests in the cities. 
Tackles fundamental concerns like CRUD, dependency injection, connecting to a database, authentication, versioning & documenting your API, and much more.
